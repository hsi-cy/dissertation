He did not want to present them in a ""sensationalized way [that] they're presented in the press, but as normal people"".

1073,Monty Python's Flying Circus,comedy,"Monty Python’s Flying Circus is a British sketch comedy series created by the comedy group Monty Python and broadcast by the BBC from 1969 to 1974. The shows were composed of surreality, risqué or innuendo-laden humour, sight gags and observational sketches without punchlines. It also featured animations by Terry Gilliam, often sequenced or merged with live action. The first episode was recorded on 7 September and broadcast on 5 October 1969 on BBC One, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV.The show often targets the idiosyncrasies of British life, especially that of professionals, and is at times politically charged. The members of Monty Python were highly educated. Terry Jones and Michael Palin are Oxford University graduates; Eric Idle, John Cleese, and Graham Chapman attended Cambridge University; and American-born member Terry Gilliam is an Occidental College graduate. Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual, with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures. The series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his ground breaking series Q5, rather than the traditional sketch show format. The team intended their humour to be impossible to categorise, and succeeded so completely that the adjective ""Pythonesque"" was invented to define it and, later, similar material.Monty Python's Flying Circus featuring Eric Idle and Connie Booth has one or more episodes streaming with subscription on Netflix, and available for purchase on iTunes.

This kind of adaptation technique—turning multiple shows into one show—was originally used in such anime programs as Robotech and Voltron, though this was one of the first times this technique was used for a tokusatsu adaptation. On May 7, 2010 the copyright for VR Troopers was transferred from BVS International to SCG Power Rangers.Saban's VR Troopers was the first official ""sister series"" to the most popular ""action fighting kid show"" at the time, Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. Much like it, this was an Americanization of a Japanese tokusatsu children's program by Toei Company LTD.The series was deemed successful, but not as successful as the Power Rangers franchise. Unfortunately, for the series, the Japanese footage was quickly exhausted due to extreme cases where multiple tokusatsu scenes were put together in one episode to the extent where stock footage had to be reused multiple times throughout the series. Similarly, another Saban program, Big Bad Beetleborgs, would do well but ultimately end quickly due to a lack of stock footage. Both series were adapted from the Japanese Metal Heroes series. The show spawned a toy line and a video game for the Sega Genesis and Sega Game Gear.VR Troopers featuring Mike Reynolds and Kerrigan Mahan has one or more episodes streaming with subscription on Netflix, available for purchase on iTunes, and available for purchase on Prime Video.
